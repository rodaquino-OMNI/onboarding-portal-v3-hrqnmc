## Introduction

### Project Description and Architecture
The Pre-paid Health Plan Onboarding Portal is a comprehensive web-based system designed to automate and streamline the enrollment process for new health plan beneficiaries. The system uses a microservices architecture deployed on Azure Cloud, with strict security and compliance requirements.

### Code of Conduct and Ethics
- Maintain highest standards of professionalism
- Respect patient data privacy
- Follow LGPD compliance guidelines
- Report security concerns immediately
- Maintain confidentiality of proprietary information

### Getting Started Guide
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required development tools
3. Set up local development environment
4. Configure access to AUSTA services
5. Review security and compliance documentation

### LGPD Compliance Overview
All contributions must adhere to LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) requirements:
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Security by design
- Privacy by default
- Audit trail maintenance

## Development Environment

### System Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 LTS
- Java OpenJDK 17
- Python 3.11+
- Go 1.21+
- Docker Desktop 24.0+
- Azure CLI latest version
- Git 2.40+

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/austa/health-plan-onboarding

# Install dependencies
npm install        # Auth Service
mvn install       # Enrollment & Policy Services
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Health Service
go mod download   # Document Service

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### Docker Environment Configuration
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: local_dev_only
  redis:
    image: redis:7.0
  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    command: server /data
```

### Database and Cache Setup
- PostgreSQL 15+ for transactional data
- Redis 7.0+ for caching
- MinIO for document storage
- TimescaleDB for audit logs

### Integration with AUSTA Services
- Configure local development proxies
- Set up mock services for development
- Use development credentials for APIs

## Development Workflow

### Git Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production releases
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features (prefix with JIRA ID)
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Production fixes

### Commit Message Standards
```
type(scope): description [JIRA-ID]

- type: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore
- scope: auth|health|enroll|policy|doc
- description: Clear, concise explanation
- JIRA-ID: Related ticket number
```

### Code Review Requirements
- Minimum 2 approvals required
- Security team approval for sensitive changes
- Architecture review for major changes
- All CI checks must pass
- No high/critical vulnerabilities

### Testing Procedures
1. Run unit tests locally
2. Execute integration tests
3. Perform E2E testing
4. Validate security requirements
5. Check performance benchmarks

### Security Review Process
1. Static code analysis
2. Dependency vulnerability scan
3. LGPD compliance check
4. Security team review
5. Penetration testing for major changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Test all business logic paths
- Mock external dependencies
- Include error scenarios
- Document test cases

### Integration Testing Requirements
```typescript
// Example integration test structure
describe('Enrollment API', () => {
  it('should create new enrollment', async () => {
    // Setup
    // Execute
    // Verify
    // Cleanup
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing Procedures
- Use Cypress for frontend testing
- Test critical user workflows
- Verify integration points
- Validate error handling
- Check accessibility compliance

### Performance Testing Guidelines
- Response time < 200ms for APIs
- Document upload < 3 seconds
- Concurrent user simulation
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Load testing requirements

### Security Testing Protocol
- OWASP Top 10 verification
- Penetration testing
- Security scan compliance
- Authentication testing
- Authorization validation

## Security Requirements

### LGPD Compliance Requirements
