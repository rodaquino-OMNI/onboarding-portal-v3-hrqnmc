## Security Policy

### Scope
This security policy applies to all components of the Pre-paid Health Plan Onboarding Portal, including:
- Web applications and user interfaces
- Microservices architecture
- Database systems
- API integrations
- Infrastructure components
- Third-party service integrations

### Version Control
- Policy reviews conducted quarterly
- Updates published with semantic versioning
- Change history maintained in version control
- Annual comprehensive policy review

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Contact Information
Security Team is available 24/7:
- Email: security@austa.health
- PGP Key Fingerprint: security-team-pgp-key-fingerprint

### Response Timeline
Response times based on vulnerability severity:
- Critical: 4 hours
- High: 24 hours
- Medium: 72 hours
- Low: 1 week

### Reporting Process
1. Encrypt communication using our PGP key
2. Include detailed vulnerability description
3. Provide reproduction steps if possible
4. Include impact assessment
5. Await acknowledgment within specified response time
6. Maintain confidentiality during investigation
7. Receive updates on mitigation progress

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
